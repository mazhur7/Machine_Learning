### Introductional
My Simple datapipline to create Machine Learning Algoritms in Python as Master Machine Learning on Python.
Includet thome code templates, visualisation of concepts, fundamental statistical functions.

### Technologies
* Python 3+

    #####  Python IDEs 
     * Google Colaboratory
     * Anaconda Spyder
     * Jupyter Notebook
     * Visual Studio
      
     ##### Python libraries
     *  numpy, * matplotlib.pyplot, * pandas


### Part 1. Data Preprocessing:
We have to prepare some stuff in order to make sure that we build our machine learning models without any issues.

/b main two feature scaling techniques:

 * (x-mean(x))/(standard deviation (x))
 Python: 
 * "X" norm" = "  (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min‚Å°(x))


## Setup
To run this project,
